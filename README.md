# Preface

Hi, my name is Tommaso and I've always been passionate about fantasy and mmorpg games, especially when (back in 1999) I discovered Ultima OnLine.

I am a very curious person and as such every year I set myself challenges in order to grow professionally and the challenge of 2023 is to create a 2d MMORPG in C#

# What is Dark Star?:

**The project is still in the early stage**

Dark Star is a fantasy roguelike game where the entire game world is procedurally generated. In this game, the player has to go through the underworld of the game,

encountering monsters and exploring procedurally generated dungeons. The game is known for its difficulty, as the player has to fight for survival in a hostile world, where even one wrong choice can lead to the death of his character.

In Dark Star, the player has the choice between different character classes, each with their own unique abilities and characteristics. Furthermore, the game features a progression system that allows the player to upgrade his character as he progresses through the game.
